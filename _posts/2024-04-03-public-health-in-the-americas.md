## Public health in the Americas

Writing this from a coffee shop in Buenos Aires. It's a rainstorm outside; I and many others are hiding from the elements, me personally given my lack of an umbrella, my sightseeing plans literally rained on by the weather.

Enough of my climate woes. I'm in Argentina to attend the <a href="https://phmovement.org/pha5"> 5th People's Health Assembly </a>, an event organised every 5 years by activists in the <a href="https://phmovement.org/"> People's Health Movement </a>, a global network of grassroots health organisations from countries across the global South and North. The assembly is next week, giving me a bit of time to see some of the rest of the country (vanishingly little unfortunately, given the geography of Argentina), and learn a little about the history, politics and contexts that have shaped public health and healthcare in the Americas.
