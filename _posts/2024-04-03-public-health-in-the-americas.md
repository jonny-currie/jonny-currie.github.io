## Public health in the Americas

---

### The People's Health Assembly 5, Mar Del Plata

Writing this from a coffee shop in Buenos Aires. It's a rainstorm outside; I and many others are hiding from the elements, me personally given my lack of an umbrella, my sightseeing plans literally rained on by the weather.

Enough of my climate woes. I'm in Argentina to attend the <a href="https://phmovement.org/pha5"> 5th People's Health Assembly </a>, an event organised every 5 years by activists in the <a href="https://phmovement.org/"> People's Health Movement </a>, a global network of grassroots health organisations from countries across the global South and North. The assembly is next week, giving me a bit of time to see some of the rest of the country (vanishingly little unfortunately, given the geography of Argentina), and learn a little about the history, politics and contexts that have shaped public health and healthcare in the Americas.

### Politics and public health

Ever since I first got involved in global and public health in university, I've been intrigued by some of the continent's approaches. Yes, there's a fair amount of romanticised idealism for the continent's politics, exemplified probably by what was once some ubiquitous imagery of a certain <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Che-Guevara"> Argentinian doctor and military leader <a/> who played a pivotal role in the Cuban revolution.

I'm sure there's much nuance here to appreciate, but I wonder what those who have shown respect and appreciation over the years for the political struggles abroad, for instance the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frente_Sandinista_de_Liberaci%C3%B3n_Nacional"> Sandinista movement in Nicaragua <a/>, would say about the scores of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/09/prison-economic-ruin-repression-exile-nicaraguas-health-workers/"> disappearing doctors in the country <a/> care of the Ortega administration, or that the same country has among Latin America's <a href="https://confidencial.digital/english/who-report-covid-deaths-vastly-underreported-in-nicaragua/"> greatest underreported COVID deaths since 2020 </a>, never mind the policies and actions of a number of other Latin American leaders over the years.

Still, countries of the Latin American continent have demonstrated some genuinely effective policies and innovations when it comes to public health. Could that be due to their relative independence liberation from its colonial rulers in the 19th century, the freedom borne out of autonomy from the US and post-war global economic and development institutions? Or perhaps it's been in some cases a genuine commitment to social goals, or even (lacking resources for expensive services) necessity. 

Anyway, as we'll see in the next few blogs, there is much we can learn when it comes to public health and healthcare from Latin America, particularly for those interested in the delivery of preventative, community-orientated and integrated services. Let's start though with some data to help us understand which countries to focus on.

### Life expectancy in the Americas

To understand the state of public health in the Americas, how it's changed over the years, and how it fares compared with other low- and middle-income countries around the world, we're going to draw on data from the World Bank's <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/"> Open Data platform <a/>. I'll have to add the code to an RMarkdown page at a later date, for now let's start with the graph below created with World Bank Open Data on regional life expectancy at birth trends, between 1960 and 2021:
