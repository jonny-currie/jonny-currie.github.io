## Primary care in Brazil - the Brazilian Family Health Strategy

---

### Day 1 PHA5 in Mar Del Plata

It's day 1 of the <a href="https://phmovement.org/pha5"> 5th People's Health Assembly <a/> in Mar del Plata, Argentina. The crowds of around 900 arrived from countries across the global South and North arrived late into the night last night - friends and comrades embracing, smiling, laughing. It's a beautiful sight too this morning with the sun rising over the sea, the conference at a small beach town that a friend and I thought had tones of Bournemouth/Weston Super Mare, with obviously a Latin twist.

I've got <a href ="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.harris"> Matt Harris <a/> to thank for this blog. OK, and a few morning coffees too. Matt and I have spoken on and off for years since I saw him pitch, to a room of GPs at a Royal College of GPs conference in Glasgow, the idea of deploying community health workers in the UK. North Wales of all places. Community health workers are typically recruited from the area they work, form part of the core primary care team, have training in key, simple health tasks, and have a cohort of households whom they visit either proatively, looking for unmet health needs (vaccination, chronic diseases, and wider), or reactively, for example being first contact for unwell children.

The pitch, later to the National Institute of Health Research panels who were to make the decision on the research idea, fell down at a late hurdle. Matt has advocated ever since for the community health worker programme, recently succeeding in attracting investment in <a href="https://www.newlocal.org.uk/articles/community-health-workers/"> London <a/>, drawing attention to their success, also around the rest of the world, but particularly as part of Brazil's health strategy since 1994.

This blog is less about community health workers in general, but a brief overview of some of the changes brought in to improve public health and primary care delivery in Brazil, looking into, as we've done in previous blogs, what we could take back to Wales and the UK from South and Latin American health systems.

### Brazil's Family Health Strategy

Brazil recognises, much like several other South American and other countries, health care as a <a href="https://histecon.fas.harvard.edu/climate-loss/brazil/index.html#:~:text=This%20right%20is%20unambiguously%20outlined,and%20equal%20access%20to%20all"> constititional right <a/>. In the 80s and 90s though, the government recognised an over-reliance on secondary care, and so began in 1994 a <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/case-study/2016/dec/brazils-family-health-strategy-using-community-health-care-workers#:~:text=Brazil's%20Family%20Health%20Strategy%20started,six%20CHWs%20(Exhibit%201)."> federal programme <a/> to provide integrated primary care. At the heart of this strategy was the roll-out of teams comprising a primary care doctor, nurse, and 6 community health workers (see image below). Other professionals linked in, including psychologists, pharmacists and physiotherapists, with the teams covering around 3-4000 people - each community health worker being assigned to up to 150 families.

Households would receive at least one visit a month from a community health worker, maximising the quality of health data on the population, helping people understand their health conditions and treatment, and the community health worker liaising closely with the wider primary care team. Community health workers took on a wide variety of roles ranging from health education, health promotion, community development, healthcare navigation and more. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182336"> Other developments <a/> took place under the Family Health Strategy around the same time, including increased investment, improved coverage by the public healthcare system (meaning people no longer had to pay for care), conditional cash transfer programmes (people receive money if they participate in a social programme, for example prenatal care or childhood immunisation), making it somewhat tricky to distinguish what programme had the greatest effect. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182336"> This review <a/> suggested the strategy had clear favourable impacts on child mortality, and potentially on reductions in hospital admissions from conditions linked with the quality of primary care quality.

### Implications for the UK

Sound familiar?
