## Healthcare in Cuba: failed experiment in socialised medicine, or something else?

---

Cuba was one of the outliers we learnt about in university. Small country, limited wealth, cut off from much of the world economy. Yet, somehow managing to make much with what the country had. As we saw in our <a href="https://jonny-currie.github.io/2024/04/03/public-health-in-the-americas.html"> last blog <a/>, Cuban life expectancy at birth, the average length a child born can expect to live given current mortality rates, rivals many high-income nations. In fact, look at the chart below - since around 1980, the country has performed similarly on its life expectancy to the USA. Yes OK, we're maybe setting the bar a bit low with a country with a <a href="https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/12/06/why-life-expectancy-in-america-is-down-again?utm_medium=cpc.adword.pd&utm_source=google&ppccampaignID=19495686130&ppcadID=&utm_campaign=a.22brand_pmax&utm_content=conversion.direct-response.anonymous&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwwr6wBhBcEiwAfMEQs-WTQfKjlhaVzDkO3LoAX51kFx3BAHiWjvuTA-ln48yQwdyQaxfMLxoCWzgQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds"> notoriously low life expectancy <a/>, horrendous inequality and an appalling mismatch between the wealth it generates and benefits for its citizens. But there's still something worthwhile about the comparison.

Compare this similarity with the stark disparities in the economies of the USA and Cuba, and the picture starts to become clearer. Somehow, a country isolated from the world economy, with limited resources, is managing to sustain its citizens to living a very reasonably long life. I think it's worth exploring - and have been reading <a href ="https://monthlyreview.org/product/cuban-health-care/"> 'Cuban Health Care - the ongoing revolution'<a/> by the author Don Fitz, whose daughter went to the <a href ="https://medicc.org/ns/elam/"> Latin American School of Medicine <a/> in Havana.
